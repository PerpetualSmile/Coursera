# Coursera Assignments
This repository aims to help Coursera learners who have difficulty completing some assignments. In addition, I also use this repository to mark some useful code snippet, classic cases or impressive tricks which I met when learning on Coursera.
 All the quizs and assignments are belong to Coursera. Please do not use them for any other purposes.
